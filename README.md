This is one of my first school-projects i've done with a classmate.
This is done with a MySQL database & without any front-end.

The idea is to represent a schoolmanagement system in wich you can register students, courses, education & teachers.
This was a project to learn how to work with a database and different relationships between different tables and how to read data from them.
